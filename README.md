# Convolutional-neural-network-image-detection
A simple Cnn which can be used to detect whether the given image is a cat or a dog. 
You can simply change the dataset and then classify it accordingly.
The following model gives an accuracy close to 82 percent.
(Just make sure to chane the name of the dataset before running. Also you need to install keras )

If you are using anaconda : To install keras simply type
conda install -c conda-forge keras
in the annaconda prompt.
